    <p>
      Hi, my name is Abigail, and I’m a third-year international student from the Philippines pursuing a combined major in behavioral neuroscience and data science
      —a major I did not expect to ever pursue. I initially started as a Computer Science major, but my growing interest in biology and psychology, along with the realization
       that traditional computer science wasn’t the right fit for me, led me to explore other options. I still wanted something that involved technology and coding while allowing
       me to apply those skills in meaningful ways—ultimately guiding me toward Data Science. My interest in biology and psychology led me to choose behavioral neuroscience, where
       I can combine my interests in understanding the brain and human behavior.
      </p>

        When I’m not focused on academics or chores, I spend some time on experimenting with different matcha powders for my lattes, especially after realizing that homemade ones
         were a lot better than the ones I would find at cafes–and cost a lot less. Lately, I’ve been making an effort to read more, hoping to reconnect with a hobby that I had to
         set aside because of my schedule. I typically read fiction, with a preference for mystery novels, especially those with mind-blowing plot twists.
      </p>
