     <h3>Matcha Reviews</h3>
        <h4>Ippodo - Sayaka (5/5)</h4>
        <p>Sayaka by Ippodo is my favorite so far. It’s reasonably priced—not too expensive, but also not cheap. According to the brand, it’s recommended for first-timers trying their matcha, and I can see why. It’s perfectly balanced: in a latte, you can still taste the umami without it being too bitter. The smooth flavor is just right, making it a great all-around choice.</p>
      
        <h4>Ippodo - Nodoka (5/5)</h4>
        <p>Nodoka by Ippodo is a unique find, as it’s only available in the spring. The price is similar to Sayaka, but the flavor is distinct. It's a brighter green, and it has a stronger umami and vegetal flavor compared to Sayaka. While I really enjoyed it, it’s unfortunate that it’s a seasonal option, making it harder to get year-round.</p>
      
        <h4>Kanbayashi Shunsho - Matsu no Mukashi (2.5/5)</h4>
        <p>Matsu no Mukashi by Kanbayashi Shunsho was a bit disappointing. It's one of the cheapest matcha powders I’ve tried, and you definitely get what you pay for. The flavor is light and gets overpowered by the milk when made into a latte. There’s also a slight bitterness and astringency. I tried sifting it before whisking, but I still noticed a gritty texture in my mouth, which made it less enjoyable overall.</p>
      
        <h4>To Try:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Itoh Kyuemon - Ajirogi</li>
          <li>Ippodo - Ummon</li>
          <li>Rocky’s Matcha - Ceremonial Blend</li>
          <li>Yamamasa Koyamaen - Ogurayama</li>
        </ul>
